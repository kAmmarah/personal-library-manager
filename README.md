🗂️ Step 1: Create Folder for Your Project

✅ On your desktop or anywhere you like, create a new folder.
👉 Name it something like: my_library_app
📂 Open this folder. Inside it, you'll add 3 files:
app.py → this will have your Streamlit code
image.png → your library background image
sample_books.csv (optional) → your book data

🧑‍💻 Step 2: Create and Add the Code (app.py)

Open any code editor (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
Create a new file inside your folder → name it:
📄 p-l-m.py
Paste your full Python code inside p-l-m.py
✅ You've already built this with emoji UI, background image, and navigation!

🖼️ Step 3: Add Background Image (image.png)

📷 Save a library-style image (you already uploaded one before).
Rename the image to:
🖼️ image.png
Put this image inside the same folder as p-l-m.py

📄 Step 4: Add Sample Book File (Optional)

Open Notepad or any text editor.(Optional)
Save the file as:
📄 sample_books.csv
➕ Save it inside the same project folder.

🧪 Step 5: Install Streamlit (Only Once)

If you haven’t installed Streamlit yet:
Open your terminal or command prompt, then run:
pip install streamlit pandas  
✅ This installs everything your app needs.

🚀 Step 6: Run Your Streamlit App

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to your project folder:
cd path_to_your_folder/personal_library_manager
3. Then run your app using this command:
streamlit run p-l-m.py
🎉 Your browser will automatically open with your app!
